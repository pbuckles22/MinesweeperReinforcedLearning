# Minesweeper RL Project - Context Summary for Chat Restart

## üéØ **Project Overview**
This is a Reinforcement Learning environment for Minesweeper using Stable Baselines3 (PPO) with curriculum learning and MLflow tracking. The project focuses on training an AI agent to play Minesweeper through progressive difficulty stages.

## üîß **Major Fixes Implemented**

### **1. Seeding Consistency Fix**
**Problem**: Training and evaluation environments produced different board layouts even with the same seed.
**Solution**: 
- Updated `MinesweeperEnv` to use modern NumPy Generator API (`np.random.default_rng()`)
- Added proper `seed()` method to environment
- Fixed `_place_mines()` method to use environment's random number generator
- **Result**: Training and evaluation now use identical board layouts with same seed

### **2. Action Masking Implementation**
**Problem**: Agent could click already-revealed cells, leading to invalid actions.
**Solution**:
- Added `ActionMaskingWrapper` class in `train_agent.py`
- Implemented `get_action_mask()` method in environment
- Applied wrapper to both training and evaluation environments
- **Result**: Agent can no longer select invalid actions

### **3. Multi-Board Training System**
**Problem**: Agent was overfitting to single board layouts, couldn't generalize.
**Solution**:
- Created `MultiBoardTrainingWrapper` class
- Generates 20 different board variations during training
- Each reset uses a different seed (42, 43, 44, etc.)
- **Result**: Agent learns general strategies instead of memorizing specific positions

## üìä **Key Performance Results**

### **Before Fixes (Original Issue)**
- Training Buffer Win Rate: 61%
- Evaluation Win Rate: 0%
- **Problem**: Large discrepancy indicating overfitting

### **After Multi-Board Training**
- Training Win Rate: 30%
- Evaluation Win Rate: 40%
- **Result**: Agent can generalize to new board layouts!

### **4x4 with 2 Mines Difficulty Analysis**
- Random Play Win Rate: 15%
- Trained Model Win Rate: 16%
- **Conclusion**: Agent can achieve 15% target with sufficient training

## üéÆ **Curriculum System**

### **Current Curriculum Stages**
1. **Beginner**: 4x4 with 2 mines (15% win rate target)
2. **Intermediate**: 6x6 with 4 mines (12% win rate target)
3. **Easy**: 9x9 with 10 mines (10% win rate target)
4. **Normal**: 16x16 with 40 mines (8% win rate target)
5. **Hard**: 16x30 with 99 mines (5% win rate target)
6. **Expert**: 18x24 with 115 mines (3% win rate target)
7. **Chaotic**: 20x35 with 130 mines (2% win rate target)

```python
# Training environment setup
training_env = DummyVecEnv([make_env(max_board_size=(4, 4), max_mines=2)])
training_env = ActionMaskingWrapper(training_env)
training_env = MultiBoardTrainingWrapper(training_env, board_variations=20)
```

### **Seeding Implementation**
```python
# In MinesweeperEnv
self.np_random = np.random.default_rng()

def seed(self, seed=None):
    if seed is not None:
        self.np_random = np.random.default_rng(seed)
```

### **Action Masking**
```python
def get_action_mask(self):
    mask = np.ones(self.action_space.n, dtype=bool)
    for row in range(self.current_board_height):
        for col in range(self.current_board_width):
            if self.revealed[row, col]:
                action_idx = row * self.current_board_width + col
                mask[action_idx] = False
    return mask
