# Test Checklist

## High Priority Issues (Core Functionality)

### Action Space and Board Size Issues
- [ ] Fix `current_board_size` attribute references (use `current_board_width` and `current_board_height`)
- [ ] Update action space calculations to use correct dimensions
- [ ] Fix board size validation in initialization tests

### Mine Hit and Game Termination
- [ ] Fix mine hit state updates and rewards
- [ ] Ensure proper game termination on mine hits
- [ ] Fix first move behavior and reset logic

### Invalid Action Handling
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for invalid actions
- [ ] Add reward breakdown in info dictionary
- [ ] Fix invalid action penalties

## Test Coverage Summary
- Total Tests: 57
- Passed: 32
- Failed: 19
- Errors: 6

## Implementation Notes
- Many failures are related to the transition from `current_board_size` to `current_board_width`/`current_board_height`
- Some tests need to be updated to match new error message formats
- Core mechanics tests need board state initialization fixes
- Flag placement tests need environment setup fixes
- Need to ensure consistent behavior across all test files

## Next Steps
1. Fix action space and board size issues first
2. Address mine hit and game termination logic
3. Implement proper invalid action handling
4. Update core mechanics tests
5. Fix flag placement tests
6. Improve test infrastructure
