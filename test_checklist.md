## Test Coverage Summary
- Total Tests: 57
- Passed: 32
- Failed: 19
- Errors: 6

## Priority Fixes
1. Action Space and Board Size Issues
   - Fix current_board_size references
   - Update action space calculations
   - Fix board size validation

2. Mine Hit and Game Termination
   - Fix state updates and rewards
   - Fix game termination logic
   - Fix first move behavior

3. Invalid Action Handling
   - Implement error handling
   - Add reward breakdown
   - Fix invalid action penalties

## Notes
- Many failures are related to the transition from current_board_size to current_board_width/height
- Some tests need to be updated to match new error message formats
- Core mechanics tests need board state initialization fixes
- Flag placement tests need environment setup fixes
