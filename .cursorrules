# Minesweeper RL Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a Reinforcement Learning environment for Minesweeper using Stable Baselines3 (PPO) with curriculum learning and MLflow tracking.

## Key Design Decisions
- **Pre-Cascade Safety**: Mines placed BEFORE first move. Pre-cascade period gives neutral rewards (0) to prevent punishing random guessing
- **Board Sizes**: All use (height, width) format throughout codebase
- **Reward System**: Neutral rewards during pre-cascade, normal rewards after cascade
- **Environment**: 2-channel state representation with action masking

## Important Files
- `src/core/minesweeper_env.py` - Main environment
- `src/core/train_agent.py` - Training script
- `src/core/constants.py` - Reward constants
- `tests/` - 500+ comprehensive tests

## When Helping
- Always consider the pre-cascade neutral reward system
- Use (height, width) format for board dimensions
- Check CONTEXT.md for detailed project information
- Run tests to verify changes work correctly
