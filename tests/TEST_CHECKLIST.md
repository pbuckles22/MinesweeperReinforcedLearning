# Test Checklist - Minesweeper Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
- **Total Tests**: 181
- **Current Coverage**: 43% (580 statements, 331 missing)
- **Passing**: 148 tests
- **Failing**: 33 tests
- **Target Coverage**: 60% by end of audit

## Testing Philosophy
- **Explicit Board Setup**: Use deterministic board configurations instead of random seeds
- **Public API Only**: Use only `step()`, `reset()`, and public properties - no direct state manipulation
- **Deterministic Tests**: Each test should have predictable outcomes
- **Environment API Compliance**: Tests must match actual environment behavior and gymnasium error types
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Target 60% code coverage with focus on critical paths
