- [ ] Fix adjacent mine counting (`assert np.int8(2) == 1`)
- [ ] Fix flag removal logic (`assert state[1, 1] == CELL_UNREVEALED`)
- [ ] Fix missing `flags_remaining` attribute
- [ ] Fix state transitions and representation

### Game Logic Fixes Needed (Priority 3)

- [ ] Fix reward calculation (wrong reward values)
- [ ] Fix info dictionary updates (`KeyError: 'won'`)
- [ ] Fix mine hit handling and state updates

- [ ] Fix win rate tracking (missing attribute)
- [ ] Fix curriculum learning implementation

### Script Fixes Needed (Priority 8)
- [ ] Fix PowerShell script syntax checking
- [ ] Fix script parameter validation
- [ ] Fix script environment checks
- [ ] Fix script output and error handling 

## Better Approach Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete Current Checklist (Current Priority)
1. **Fix all failing tests** on default board sizes first
2. **Get all tests passing** with current implementation
3. **Establish solid foundation** before any major refactoring

### Phase 2: Board Size Audit (Future Enhancement)
1. **Audit all tests** for board size assumptions
2. **Parameterize tests** that truly need multiple board sizes
3. **Refactor tests** that break on different board sizes
4. **Add board size parameterization** where appropriate

### Phase 3: Performance & Optimization
1. **Run full test suite** on various board sizes
2. **Optimize performance** for large boards
3. **Add comprehensive board size coverage**

**Note**: Phase 1 takes priority. Phase 2 and 3 are enhancements that can be done after all current tests are passing.

## Board Size Parameterization Guidance

Not all tests need to be run on every board size. Use this guidance to decide when to parameterize tests for board size:

### Tests that SHOULD be parameterized for board size
- Action space and action masking (action count, mapping, masking logic)
- State management (arrays for board, mines, flags, revealed)
- Mine placement and adjacency logic (placement, adjacent mine counting)
- Game flow and win/loss detection (should not assume a specific board size)
- Performance and memory usage (for large boards only)
- Edge/corner/cascade reveal logic (cascading, edge/corner handling)
- Curriculum/early learning progression (if curriculum increases board size)

### Tests that DO NOT need to be parameterized for board size
- First move safety (can be tested on a small board)
- Invalid parameter handling (negative size, too many mines, etc.)
- Reward for specific actions (flagging, hitting a mine, etc.)
- Single-cell or trivial edge cases (1x1, 2x2, 3x3 boards)

### Best Practice
- Only parameterize tests where board size could affect the outcome or expose bugs.
- Add comments to tests explaining why a single size is sufficient or why parameterization is used.
