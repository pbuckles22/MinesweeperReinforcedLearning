## Notes
- Tests should be implemented in `test_minesweeper_env.py`
- Each test should have clear documentation
- Tests should be independent and repeatable
- Tests should cover both success and failure cases
- Tests should verify all edge cases
- Tests should be efficient and not take too long to run
