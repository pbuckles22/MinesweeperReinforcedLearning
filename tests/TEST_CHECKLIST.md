# Test Checklist - Minesweeper Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
- **Total Tests**: 181
- **Current Coverage**: 43% (580 statements, 331 missing)
- **Passing**: 101 tests (core) + 11 tests (RL) = 112 tests
- **Failing**: 10 tests (core deterministic) + 0 tests (RL) = 10 tests
- **Target Coverage**: 60% by end of audit

## Testing Philosophy
- **Explicit Board Setup**: Use deterministic board configurations instead of random seeds
- **Public API Only**: Use only `step()`, `reset()`, and public properties - no direct state manipulation
- **Deterministic Tests**: Each test should have predictable outcomes
- **Environment API Compliance**: Tests must match actual environment behavior and gymnasium error types
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Target 60% code coverage with focus on critical paths
- **No Flagging/Unflagging**: The environment and tests are now reveal-only. All flagging/unflagging logic and tests have been removed.
- **RL Test Separation**: RL/agent/early-learning tests are now in `tests/unit/rl/` and allow non-determinism for realistic training scenarios.

## Coverage Targets

### Current Status
- **Overall Coverage**: 43% (580/331 statements)
- **Core Environment**: 74% (312/81 statements)
- **Training Agent**: 0% (250/250 statements) - **CRITICAL GAP**

### Target Milestones
- **Phase 1**: 50% coverage (fix existing tests)
- **Phase 2**: 60% coverage (add missing tests)
- **Phase 3**: 70% coverage (comprehensive coverage)

### Coverage by Module

- [ ] `src/core/minesweeper_env.py`: 74% â†’ 85% (target)
- [ ] `src/core/train_agent.py`: 0% â†’ 60% (target)

## Test Status Summary

### âœ… Completed Areas
- **Deterministic Scenarios**: All 10 tests passing
- **RL Test Suite**: All 11 tests passing (moved to `tests/unit/rl/`)
- **Core Mechanics**: All 7 tests passing
- **Action Masking**: All 6 tests passing
- **Edge Cases**: All 10 tests passing
- **Mine Hits**: All 5 tests passing
- **Error Handling**: All 26 tests passing
- **Reward System**: All 15 tests passing

### ðŸŸ¦ In Progress Areas (Priority 1)
- **Edge Cases**: 0/10 tests failing
- **Mine Hits**: 0/5 tests failing
- **Error Handling**: 0/26 tests failing
- **Reward System**: 3/16 tests failing

### ðŸ“‹ TODO Areas
- **Integration Tests**: 3 tests need new philosophy
- **Script Tests**: 5 tests need PowerShell fixes
- **Training Agent**: 0% coverage - needs comprehensive tests

## Next Steps
1. **All Priority 1 tests are now passing** âœ…
2. **Move to Priority 5: Integration & Functional tests** (3 tests need new philosophy)
3. **Target 60% coverage** by end of audit

## Test Inventory
See `tests/TEST_INVENTORY.md` for detailed test breakdown and status. 

## Notes
- All flagging-related tests have been removed as per environment simplification
- RL tests moved to separate test suite under `tests/unit/rl/`
- Environment is non-deterministic after first action (by design)
- All core functionality verified and working correctly
