# Minesweeper Test Checklist (Updated with New Testing Philosophy)

## Testing Philosophy & Best Practices

### âœ… **New Testing Standards (Applied to Action Masking Tests)**
- **Explicit Board Setup**: Each test explicitly sets up the board state needed for its specific scenario
- **Public API Only**: Tests use only `env.step()` and avoid direct manipulation of internal state
- **Deterministic**: No randomness - tests always test the same scenario
- **Robust Assertions**: Only assert what's actually being tested (invalid action penalty, info structure)
- **No False Assumptions**: Don't assume the environment won't terminate when it's designed to do so

### **Test Categories by Update Priority**

#### **Priority 1: Apply New Philosophy (25 tests)**
- Early Learning Tests (6 failing) - Random mine placement, state assumptions
- Game Flow Tests (2 failing) - Random win/loss scenarios  
- Performance Tests (1 failing) - Memory usage with random scenarios
- State Management Tests (4 failing) - State assumptions, random termination
- Reward System Tests (7 failing) - Random scenarios, state assumptions
- Core Mechanics Tests (4 failing) - Wrong behavior, missing features

#### **Priority 2: Fix Environment API (15 tests)**
- Error Handling Tests (15 failing) - Wrong error messages, missing validations

#### **Priority 3: Fix Implementation (10 tests)**
- Initialization Tests (4 failing) - Wrong error messages, missing validations
- Integration Tests (5 failing) - Missing attributes, wrong behavior
- Flag Placement Tests (2 failing) - Wrong state representation

#### **Priority 4: Fix Infrastructure (5 tests)**
- Script Tests (5 failing) - PowerShell syntax, missing features

## Board Size Parameterization Guidance

Not all tests need to be run on every board size. Use this guidance to decide when to parameterize tests for board size:

### Tests that SHOULD be parameterized for board size
- Action space and action masking (action count, mapping, masking logic)
- State management (arrays for board, mines, flags, revealed)
- Mine placement and adjacency logic (placement, adjacent mine counting)
- Game flow and win/loss detection (should not assume a specific board size)
- Performance and memory usage (for large boards only)
- Edge/corner/cascade reveal logic (cascading, edge/corner handling)
- Curriculum/early learning progression (if curriculum increases board size)

### Tests that DO NOT need to be parameterized for board size
- Reward system logic (rewards are relative, not absolute)
- Error handling and validation (parameter validation is independent of board size)
- Initialization and setup (setup logic is independent of board size)
- Agent training logic (agent should work on any valid board size)
- Script and infrastructure tests (these are environment-independent)

## Better Approach Strategy

### Phase 1: Complete Current Checklist (Current Priority)
1. **Fix all failing tests** on default board sizes first
2. **Get all tests passing** with current implementation
3. **Establish solid foundation** before any major refactoring

### Phase 2: Board Size Audit (Future Enhancement)
1. **Audit all tests** for board size assumptions
2. **Parameterize tests** that truly need multiple board sizes
3. **Refactor tests** that break on different board sizes
4. **Add board size parameterization** where appropriate

### Phase 3: Performance & Optimization
1. **Run full test suite** on various board sizes
2. **Optimize performance** for large boards
3. **Add comprehensive board size coverage**

**Note**: Phase 1 takes priority.
