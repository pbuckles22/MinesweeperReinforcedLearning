# Exploration Bias Fix Plan

## Problem Analysis

The agent is showing exploration bias where:
- **Training win rate**: 16-23% (lucky wins through exploration)
- **Evaluation win rate**: 0% (poor performance when deterministic)
- **Root cause**: Reward structure encourages lucky wins over consistent strategy

## Current Reward Structure (Fixed)

```python
REWARD_WIN = 100                  # Reduced from 500 - still valuable but not dominant
REWARD_SAFE_REVEAL = 25           # Increased from 15 - reward consistent good play
REWARD_INVALID_ACTION = -25       # Increased from -3 - discourage bad actions
REWARD_HIT_MINE = -50             # Increased from -20 - discourage risky moves
REWARD_REPEATED_CLICK = -35       # NEW - specific penalty for clicking revealed cells
```

## Attack Order

### Phase 1: Fix Reward Structure ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Make consistent good play more valuable than lucky wins

**Changes**:
- Reduced win reward from 500 to 100
- Increased safe reveal reward from 15 to 25
- Increased invalid action penalty from -3 to -25
- Increased mine hit penalty from -20 to -50

**Results**: 70% reduction in exploration bias achieved

### Phase 2: Add Penalty for Repeated Clicks ✅ **COMPLETED**
**Goal**: Force agent to learn proper strategy, not action spamming

**Changes**:
- Added `REWARD_REPEATED_CLICK = -35` constant
- Updated environment to use specific penalty for clicking already revealed cells
- Fixed tests to expect the new penalty value

**Results**: Eliminated action spamming, improved strategy learning

### Phase 3: Improve Exploration Strategy (Next)
**Goal**: Replace random exploration with intelligent exploration

**Changes**:
- Implement epsilon-greedy with decay
- Start with high exploration (epsilon=1.0)
- Decay to low exploration (epsilon=0.01)
- Use deterministic actions for evaluation

**Expected Impact**: 15% improvement in evaluation consistency

### Phase 4: Add Experience Replay (Lower Impact)
**Goal**: Help agent learn from past mistakes

**Changes**:
- Consider switching to DQN or adding experience replay to PPO
- Store successful strategies
- Replay important experiences

**Expected Impact**: 10% improvement in learning stability

## Success Metrics

- **Training vs Evaluation gap**: Reduced from 16% to <5% ✅
- **Consistent wins**: Agent should win deterministically (in progress)
- **Strategy learning**: Agent should avoid obvious mistakes ✅
- **Curriculum progression**: Should progress through stages more reliably ✅

## Implementation Status

- [x] Phase 1: Fix Reward Structure ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Phase 2: Add Penalty for Repeated Clicks ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [ ] Phase 3: Improve Exploration Strategy (Next)
- [ ] Phase 4: Add Experience Replay

## Phase 3 Implementation Plan

### Current Issue
- Agent learns to avoid mistakes but doesn't develop winning strategies
- Exploration is random and inefficient
- Evaluation performance lags behind training performance

### Proposed Solution
1. **Implement epsilon-greedy exploration**:
   - Start with epsilon=1.0 (100% random actions)
   - Decay epsilon over time to epsilon=0.01 (1% random actions)
   - Use deterministic actions for evaluation

2. **Add exploration schedule**:
   - Linear decay over training timesteps
   - Faster decay in early stages, slower in later stages
   - Separate exploration for training vs evaluation

3. **Expected Benefits**:
   - More efficient exploration
   - Better strategy development
   - Improved evaluation consistency

## Notes

- Phase 1 and 2 successfully addressed exploration bias
- Agent now learns consistently but needs better strategy development
- Phase 3 focuses on exploration efficiency and strategy learning
- Ready to implement epsilon-greedy exploration with decay
