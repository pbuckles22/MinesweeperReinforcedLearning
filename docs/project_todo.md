- [ ] Add controls for manual play or step-by-step execution
- [ ] Implement training progress visualization with real-time metrics
- [ ] **Agent Play Visualization App**
  - [ ] Load and run best trained model from `best_model/` directory
  - [ ] Create graphical interface showing Minesweeper board in real-time

  - [ ] Add speed controls (slow, normal, fast) for different viewing preferences
  - [ ] Show agent's confidence/probability for each move
  - [ ] Display game statistics (moves made, win/loss status, time elapsed)
  - [ ] Add replay functionality to watch the same game multiple times
  - [ ] Support multiple board sizes and difficulty levels
  - [ ] Add save/load functionality for interesting games
  - [ ] Create demo mode for showcasing agent performance
