# TODO

## Script Mode: RL Agent Training and Evaluation
- [ ] Implement a training script (`train_agent.py`) using a reinforcement learning library (e.g., Stable Baselines3, RLlib, or custom DQN/PPO).
- [ ] Add an evaluation script (`evaluate_agent.py`) to test the trained agent and log performance metrics.
- [ ] Document the training and evaluation process in the README.

## Graphical Mode: Visualizing the Agent
- [ ] Enhance the environment's `render()` method to support graphical output (e.g., using Matplotlib, Pygame, or Tkinter).
- [ ] Create a visualization script (`visualize_agent.py`) to display the agent's actions in real-time.
- [ ] Optionally, add controls for manual play or step-by-step execution.

## Documentation and Packaging
- [ ] Add a comprehensive README.md with usage examples and installation instructions.
- [ ] Consider packaging the environment as a Python package for easy distribution.
- [ ] Register the environment with Gymnasium for broader compatibility.
