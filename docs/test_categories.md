- No known issues. Ready for next phase.

## 🎯 **Critical Bug Fix Summary (2024-12-19)**

### Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Environment was resetting after first-move mine hits, breaking RL contract
- **Root Cause**: `step()` method called `self.reset()` on first-move mine hits
- **Solution**: No mine relocation; first move can be a mine.
- **Impact**: All tests now pass with correct RL environment behavior

### Test Updates Made
1. **Unit Tests**: Updated 4 failing tests to expect correct behavior
2. **Functional Tests**: Fixed 2 failing tests with proper setup
3. **Integration Tests**: Updated for 4-channel state format
4. **Removed**: All flagging-related test code
