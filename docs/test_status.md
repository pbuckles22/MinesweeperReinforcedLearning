## Integration Test Focus

The integration tests specifically address critical RL system issues:

### CustomEvalCallback Validation
- Tests our custom evaluation callback that properly handles vectorized environments
- Validates correct win detection from info dictionary
- Ensures no hanging during training evaluation

### Vectorized Environment API
- Validates correct info dictionary access patterns
- Tests both single and vectorized environment scenarios
- Ensures compatibility with gym/gymnasium APIs

### End-to-End Training
- Complete training pipeline validation
- Curriculum progression verification
- Model persistence and recovery testing

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of invalid actions
- Environment termination for edge cases
- Recovery from error conditions

## Timeout Protection

All integration tests that could potentially hang are protected with 30-second timeouts using pytest-timeout. This prevents indefinite hanging and ensures tests complete in reasonable time.

```bash
# Install timeout plugin
pip install pytest-timeout

# Run with timeouts
pytest --timeout=30
```

## Test Maintenance

### Before Committing
1. Run complete test suite: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
2. Ensure 504/504 tests pass
3. Run integration tests: `python -m pytest tests/integration/rl/ -v`
4. Validate training pipeline: `python src/core/train_agent.py --total_timesteps 1000`

### Debugging Failed Tests
- Use debug scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- Check timeout settings for integration tests
- Verify environment compatibility
- Review recent changes for API compatibility issues
