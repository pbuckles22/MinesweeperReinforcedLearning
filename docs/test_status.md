## ðŸŽ¯ **Critical Bug Fix Completed (2024-12-19)**

### Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: Environment was resetting after first-move mine hits, breaking RL contract
- **Root Cause**: `step()` method called `self.reset()` on first-move mine hits
- **Solution**: Added `_relocate_mine_from_position()` method for proper first-move safety
- **Impact**: All tests now pass with correct RL environment behavior

### Key Changes
1. **Environment**: Fixed first-move mine hit handling
2. **Unit Tests**: Updated 4 failing tests to expect correct behavior
3. **Functional Tests**: Fixed 2 failing tests with proper setup
4. **Integration Tests**: Updated for 2-channel state format
