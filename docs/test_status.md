## 🎯 **100% Pass Rate Achieved for Complete System (2024-12-19)**

## 🎯 **Critical Bug Fixes Completed (2024-12-19)**

### Stage Completion Tracking Fix
- **Problem**: `KeyError: 'stage_1'` in training agent stage completion tracking
- **Root Cause**: `stage_completion` dictionary was being overwritten instead of accumulated
- **Solution**: Fixed to properly initialize and add stages incrementally
- **Impact**: Training pipeline now properly tracks all curriculum stages

### API Compatibility Fix
- **Problem**: `evaluate_model` return format mismatch in functional tests
- **Root Cause**: Test expected tuple but function returns dictionary
- **Solution**: Updated test to use correct dictionary format
- **Impact**: All functional tests now pass

### First-Move Mine Hit Fix (Previous)
- **Problem**: Environment was resetting after first-move mine hits, breaking RL contract
- **Root Cause**: `step()` method called `self.reset()` on first-move mine hits
- **Solution**: Added `_relocate_mine_from_position()` method for proper first-move safety
- **Impact**: All core tests now pass with correct RL environment behavior
