# Curriculum Learning System

## Overview
The curriculum learning system implements progressive training from small to large Minesweeper boards, using transfer learning to accelerate learning on larger boards.

## Current Implementation: Adaptive Curriculum

### Features
- **Adaptive Progression:** Early stopping when targets are achieved
- **Transfer Learning:** Partial weight transfer between different board sizes
- **Best Model Saving:** Saves models based on evaluation performance
- **Periodic Evaluation:** Regular assessment with multiple runs
- **Regularization:** Dropout (0.4) and L2 weight decay (1e-4)

### Architecture
```
Stage 1: 4×4 (1 mine) → Stage 2: 5×5 (2 mines) → Stage 3: 6×6 (3 mines) → Stage 4: 8×8 (6 mines)
```

### Training Process
1. **Stage Initialization:** Create environment and agent for current board size
2. **Transfer Learning:** Load weights from previous stage (if available)
3. **Adaptive Training:** Train with periodic evaluation every 500 episodes
4. **Early Stopping:** Stop when target achieved 3 consecutive times
5. **Best Model Saving:** Save model with highest evaluation performance
6. **Progression:** Move to next stage with transfer learning

### Performance Summary
| Stage | Board | Target | Achieved | Best | Episodes | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | 4×4 | 90% | 78% | 78% | 20,000 | ✅ CLOSE |
| 2 | 5×5 | 70% | 37% | 46.4% | 25,000 | ❌ NEEDS WORK |
| 3 | 6×6 | 50% | 19.1% | 23.6% | 30,000 | ❌ NEEDS WORK |
| 4 | 8×8 | 20% | 0.8% | 2.0% | 40,000 | ❌ NEEDS WORK |

### Key Insights
- **Transfer Learning Works:** Successful weight transfer across all stages
- **Early Peaks:** Performance peaks in first 1,000-1,500 episodes
- **Overfitting:** Performance declines after peaks in stages 1-3
- **8×8 Difficulty:** Even 2% win rate is significant for this size

## Transfer Learning Implementation

### Weight Transfer Strategy
- **Convolutional Layers:** Direct transfer (spatial patterns)
- **Middle Dense Layers:** Direct transfer (feature representations)
- **Dueling Streams:** Direct transfer (value/advantage functions)
- **Input/Output Layers:** Reinitialized (size-specific)

### Transfer Success Rates
- **4×4 → 5×5:** 47.4% performance retention
- **5×5 → 6×6:** 51.6% performance retention
- **6×6 → 8×8:** 4.2% performance retention
